CppWAMP
=======

C++11 client library for the [WAMP][wamp] protocol.

**Features**:

- Supports the [WAMP Basic Profile][wamp-basic]
- Roles: _Caller_, _Callee_, _Subscriber_, _Publisher_
- Transports: TCP and Unix domain raw sockets (with and without handshaking support)
- Serializations: JSON and MsgPack
- Provides both callback and co-routine based asynchronous APIs
- Easy conversion between static and dynamic types
- RPC and pub/sub event handlers can have static argument types
- Header-only, but may also be optionally compiled
- Unit tested
- Permissive license (Boost)

**Dependencies**:

- [Boost.Asio][boost-asio] for raw socket transport
- [Boost.Endian][boost-endian] (requires [Boost][boost] 1.57.0 or greater)
- [RapidJSON][rapidjson]
- [msgpack-c][msgpack-c]
- (optional) [Boost.Coroutine][boost-coroutine] and
  [Boost.Context][boost-context]
- (for testing) [CMake][cmake] and the [Catch][catch] unit test framework

Usage Examples
--------------

### Establishing a WAMP session
```c++
wamp::AsioService iosvc;
boost::asio::spawn(iosvc, [&](boost::asio::yield_context yield)
{
    // Specify a TCP transport and JSON serialization
    auto tcp = wamp::legacy::TcpConnector::create(iosvc, "localhost",
                                                  8001, wamp::Json::id());

    auto client = wamp::CoroClient<>::create(tcp);
    client->connect(yield);
    auto sid = client->join("realm", yield);
    std::cout << "Client joined. Session ID = " << sid << "\n";

    // etc.
});
iosvc.run();
```

### Registering a remote procedure
```c++
void add(wamp::Invocation inv, int n, int m)
{
    inv.yield({n + m});
}

boost::asio::spawn(iosvc, [&](boost::asio::yield_context yield)
{
    ...
    auto reg = client->enroll<int, int>("add", &add, yield);
    ...
});
```

### Calling a remote procedure
```c++
auto result = client->call("add", {2, 2}, yield);
int sum = 0;
result.to(sum);
std::cout << "2 + 2 is " << sum << "\n";
```

### Subscribing to a topic
```c++
void sensorSampled(wamp::PublicationId pid, float value)
{
    std::cout << "Sensor sampled, publication ID = " << pid
              << " value = " << value << "\n";
}

boost::asio::spawn(iosvc, [&](boost::asio::yield_context yield)
{
    ...
    auto sub = client->subscribe<float>("sensorSampled", &sensorSampled,
                                        yield);
    ...
});
```

### Publishing an event
```c++
float value = std::rand() % 10;
client->publish("sensorSampled", {value});
```
