CppWAMP
=======

C++11 client library for the [WAMP][wamp] protocol.

**Features**:

- Supports the WAMP _Basic Profile_
- Supports [some advanced WAMP profile features](#advanced)
- Roles: _Caller_, _Callee_, _Subscriber_, _Publisher_
- Transports: TCP and Unix domain raw sockets (with and without handshaking support)
- Serializations: JSON and MsgPack
- Provides both callback and co-routine based asynchronous APIs
- Easy conversion between static and dynamic types
- RPC and pub/sub event handlers can have static argument types
- User-defined types can be registered and exchanged via RPC and pub-sub
- Header-only, but may also be optionally compiled
- Unit tested
- Permissive license (Boost)

**Dependencies**:

- [Boost.Asio][boost-asio] for raw socket transport
- [Boost.Endian][boost-endian] (requires [Boost][boost] 1.58.0 or greater)
- [RapidJSON][rapidjson]
- [msgpack-c][msgpack-c]
- (optional) [Boost.Coroutine][boost-coroutine] and
  [Boost.Context][boost-context]
- (for testing) [CMake][cmake] and the [Catch][catch] unit test framework

Usage Examples (using coroutines)
---------------------------------

_For a more comprehensive overview, check out the [Tutorials](https://github.com/ecorm/cppwamp/wiki/Tutorial) in the wiki._

### Establishing a WAMP session
```c++
wamp::AsioService iosvc;
boost::asio::spawn(iosvc, [&](boost::asio::yield_context yield)
{
    // Specify a TCP transport and JSON serialization
    auto tcp = connector<Json>(iosvc, TcpHost("localhost", 8001));
    auto session = wamp::CoroSession<>::create(tcp);
    session->connect(yield);
    auto sessionInfo = session->join(Realm("myrealm"), yield);
    std::cout << "Client joined. Session ID = "
              << sessionInfo.id() << "\n";
    // etc.
});
iosvc.run();
```

### Registering a remote procedure
```c++
boost::asio::spawn(iosvc, [&](boost::asio::yield_context yield)
{
    :::
    session->enroll(Procedure("add"), basicRpc<int, int, int>(
                    [](int n, int m) -> int {return n+m;}),
                    yield);
    :::
});
```

### Calling a remote procedure
```c++
auto result = session->call(Rpc("add").withArgs(2, 2), yield);
std::cout << "2 + 2 is " << result[0].to<int>() << "\n";
```

### Subscribing to a topic
```c++
void sensorSampled(float value)
{
    std::cout << "Sensor sampled, value = " << value << "\n";
}

boost::asio::spawn(iosvc, [&](boost::asio::yield_context yield)
{
    :::
    session->subscribe(Topic("sensorSampled"),
                       basicEvent<float>(&sensorSampled),
                       yield);
    :::
});
```

### Publishing an event
```c++
float value = std::rand() % 10;
session->publish(Pub("sensorSampled").withArgs(value));
```
