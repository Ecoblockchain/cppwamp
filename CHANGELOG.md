v0.6.1
======
Bug fixes.

- Fixed encoding of multibyte UTF-8 sequences to JSON (fixes #96).
- Added test case for converting multibyte UTF-8 sequences to JSON.

v0.6.0
======
Better support for asynchronous RPC and event handlers.

Breaking Changes:
- `Session` and `CoroSession` now take an extra `boost::asio::io_service`
  argument in their `create()` functions. This IO service is now used for
  executing user-provided handlers. It can be the same one used by the
  transport connectors.
- Support for non-handshaking raw socket transports has been
  removed (closes #92).

Enhancements:
- Added `basicCoroRpc()`, `basicCoroEvent()`, `unpackedCoroRpc()`, and
  `unpackedCoroEvent()` wrappers, which execute a call/event slot within the
  context of a coroutine. This should make it easier to implement RPC/event
  handlers that need to run asynchronously themselves (closes #91).
- `Invocation` and `Event` now have an `iosvc()` getter, which returns the
  user-provided `asio::io_service` (closes #91).
- Added `Variant` conversion facilities for `std::set` and `set::unordered_set`.

v0.5.3
======
Fixes and enhancements.

- Added support for binary WAMP payloads (closes #50)
- Fixed wrong header guard in <cppwamp/types/unorderedmap.hpp> (fixes #73)
- Added `SessionErrc` mappings to new predefined error URIs added to
  the spec (closes #77)
- Added recently proposed `exclude_authid`, `exclude_authrole`,
  `eligible_authid`, `eligible_authrole` options (closes #80).
- Fixed `ScopedRegistration`s and `ScopedSubscription`s that weren't being
  moved properly (fixes #82).
- Added `basicRpc` and `basicEvent` functions. `basicRpc` allows the
  registration of statically-typed RPC handlers that don't take an `Invocation`
  parameter and don't return an `Outcome` result. Likewise, `basicEvent` allows
  the registration of statically-typed event handlers that don't take an
  `Event` parameter (closes #84).

v0.5.2
======
More fixes for v0.5.0 release.

- Fixed JSON encoding of control characters (fixes #72)
- Added test case for converting derived DTO classes (see #70)

v0.5.1
======
Minor fixes and enhancements to v0.5.0 release.

- Fixed namespace-related errors that occur for user-defined conversions.
- Can now specify a fallback value when extracting an object member during conversion.
- Added Rpc::captureError which allows users to retrieve ERROR message details returned by a callee.
- Variant-to-Variant conversion is now handled properly.

v0.5.0
======
User-defined type support.

### New Features
- Users may now register custom types that can be converted to/from `Variant`. These registered custom types may be passed directly to RPC and pub/sub operations and handlers. See *Custom Variant Conversions* in the tutorial for usage examples (closes #69).
- `timeservice` and `timeclient` examples have been provided which showcase the use of conversion facilities. These examples use the CppWAMP library in a header-only fashion (closes #67).
- Converters have been provided for `std::unordered_map` and `boost::optional` (closes #68).

### Breaking Changes
- `Payload::withArgs` now takes variadic arguments, instead of a `std::initializer_list<Variant>`. This change makes it possible for registered user-defined types to be automatically converted to `Variant`. Wherever you do `Rpc("foo").withArgs({"hello", 42})` should be changed to `Rpc("foo").withArgs("hello", 42)` (notice the removed curly braces).
- `std::tuple` support is now provided via the new conversion facilities, in `<cppwamp/types/tuple.hpp>`.

### Other Changes
- Fixed compile errors that occur only when the library is used in a header-only fashion.

v0.4.0
======
Connection API improvements.

### Breaking Changes
- `TcpConnector` and `UdsConnector` have been replaced with `connector` factory functions in `<cppwamp/tcp.hpp>` and `<cppwamp/uds.hpp>`. The new interface uses a fluent API which allows the user to specify `setsockopt` socket options (closes #63). Consult the revised tutorials and documentation to learn how to migrate your app code to the revised connection interface.
- Revised connection API so that unused serialization libraries are not needed when using CppWAMP in a header-only fashion (fixes #64).

### Other Changes
- Raw socket transports now use 16MB as the default maximum length for incoming messages (closes #39).

v0.3.1
======
Fixes and additional tests.

### Details
- Added as many test cases as possible for supported advanced WAMP features. Some features cannot be tested because they are not supported on Crossbar, or they are not "symmetrically" supported on CppWAMP (closes #43).
- Added test cases where asynchronous Session operations are executed within call/event slots (closes #44).
- Made changes to allow building with Clang on OS X (thanks taion!) (fixes #55).
- Added test case for constructing `Variant` from `std::vector` (closes #58).
- `Rpc`, `Procedure`, `Pub`, `Topic`, and friends now have converting (implicit) constructors (closes #60).
- NaN and infinite `Real` values are now encoded as `null` over JSON (fixes #61).
- Fixed `unpackedEvent` and `unpackedRpc` so that they can take a lambda functions by value.
- Reorganized `wamptest.cpp` so that related test cases are grouped in `SCENARIO` blocks. The Crossbar router process can no longer be forked from the test suite because of this.

v0.3.0
======
Made further refinements to the API. The minimal Boost library version required is now 1.58.0.

### Details
- The library now depends on Boost 1.58, which now includes Boost.Endian. This removes the dependency on the "standalone" Boost.Endian (closes #5).
- Revamped subscriptions and registrations to more closely model Boost.Signals2 connection management. Users are no longer forced to keep `Subscription`/`Registration` objects alive. `ScopedSubscription` and `ScopedRegistraton` have been added to permit automatic lifetime management, if desired (closes #45).
- RPC handlers are now required to return an `Outcome` object. This makes it harder to forget returning a result from within an RPC handler (closes #46).
- Statically-typed call/event handlers are now handled by `EventUnpacker` and `InvocationUnpacker` wrappers. This eliminates the need for `Session::subscribe` and `Session::enroll` overloads, and greatly simplifies subscription/registration management (closes #51).
- Unpacking of positional arguments for statically-typed call/event slots now uses a simpler technique inspired by `std::integer_sequence` (closes #52)
- Updated examples and tests to use raw socket handshaking, which is now supported on Crossbar (closes #54).

v0.2.0
======
Overhauled API to make use of fluent API techniques. Some Advanced WAMP Profile features are now supported.

### Details
- Renamed some classes:
  - `Client` -> `Session`
  - `CoroClient` -> `CoroSession`
  - `internal::Session` -> `internal::Dialogue`
  - `internal::ClientImplBase` -> `internal::ClientInterface`
  - `internal::ClientImpl` -> `internal::Client`
- Removed the `Args` class, as similar functionality is now provided by `Payload` with a cleaner API
- Folded `CoroErrcClient` into `CoroClient` (now `SessionClient`) by taking an extra, optional `std::error_code` pointer
- `Session` (formerly `Client`) now makes extensive use of fluent API techniques, via data objects declared in `<cppwamp/dialoguedata.hpp>` and `<cppwamp/sessiondata.hpp>` (fixes #6, fixes #7, fixes #34)
- `Subscription` and `Registration` are now returned via shared pointer, and are no longer "handle" objects that mimic a shared pointer (fixes #40).
- Added `operator[]` support to `Variant`, to make it more convenient to access elements/members.
- Added `Variant::valueOr` to make it easier to treat a Variant as an optional value.
- Added support for the "low-hanging fruit" among advanced WAMP features. These are features that only require some `Details` or `Options` attributes to be set, and require no other special treatment by the client (fix #10, fix #11, fix #12, fix #13, fix #14, fix #15, fix #23, fix #24, fix #25, fix #26, fix #27, fix #35, fix #37, fix #38):
  - General: agent identification, feature announcement
  - _Callee_: `call_trustlevels`, `caller_identification`, `pattern_based_registration`, progressive_call_results
  - _Caller_: `call_timeout`, `callee_blackwhite_listing`, `caller_exclusion`, `caller_identification`
  - _Publisher_: `publisher_exclusion`, `publisher_identification`, `subscriber_blackwhite_listing`
  - _Subscriber_: `pattern_based_subscription`, `publication_trustlevels`, `publisher_identification`

v0.1.2
======
Initial public release.
